# CuriousPI
Welcome to CuriousPI, a repository dedicated to exploring curious and unconventional methods for calculating the mathematical constant PI.

## About PI
PI (Ï€) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Its value is approximately 3.14159, but its decimal expansion continues infinitely without repetition. PI is used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering.

## About the Repository
This repository contains various methods for calculating PI that you may not have seen before. The implementations may be inefficient or impractical for real-world applications, but they are nonetheless interesting to explore and can help deepen our understanding of the constant.

## Contributing
If you have a curious or unconventional method for calculating PI that you would like to share, feel free to contribute to this repository! Simply fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your implementation.
